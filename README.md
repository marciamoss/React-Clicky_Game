* This app is a memory game with React.js. 
* This application's UI is broken into components and manages component state, and responds to user events.
* The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
* The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 
* The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
* The top score keeps track of the maximum score achieved by the user throughout all games during that session.
